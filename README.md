# Learning Management System

A fullstack Learning Management System (LMS) built with Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and modern frontend technologies. This project enables educators to create, manage, and deliver online courses, while providing students with an interactive and engaging learning experience.

The frontend and backend have distinct code layers within one Next.js deployment. See [the architecture guide](docs/architecture.md) for request flow, dependency rules, and how to add features.
